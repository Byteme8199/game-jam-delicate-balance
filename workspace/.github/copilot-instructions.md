# Copilot Instructions for PhaserJS Game Development

This workspace is for developing a PhaserJS game. Please follow these best practices:

1. Use PhaserJS version 3.x for compatibility.
2. Organize game assets (images, audio, etc.) in a structured folder hierarchy (e.g., `assets/images`, `assets/audio`).
3. Write modular code by separating game scenes into individual files.
4. Use ES6+ features for cleaner and more maintainable code.
5. Test the game frequently in different browsers to ensure compatibility.
6. Document all custom functions and classes with JSDoc comments.
